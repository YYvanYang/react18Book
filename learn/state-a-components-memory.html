<p>Components often need to change what's on the screen as a result of an interaction. Typing into the form should update the input field, clicking &quot;next&quot; on an image carousel should change which image is displayed, clicking &quot;buy&quot; should put a product in the shopping cart. Components need to &quot;remember&quot; things: the current input value, the current image, the shopping cart. In React, this kind of component-specific memory is called <em>state</em>.</p>

<p>Here's a component that renders a sculpture image. Clicking the &quot;Next&quot; button should show the next sculpture by changing the <code>index</code> to <code>1</code>, then <code>2</code>, and so on. However, this <strong>won't work</strong> (you can try it!):</p>

<p>The <code>handleClick</code> event handler is updating a local variable, <code>index</code>. But two things prevent that change from being visible:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Local variables don't persist between renders.</strong> When React renders this component a second time, it renders it from scratch—it doesn't consider any changes to the local variables.</li>
<li><strong>Changes to local variables won't trigger renders.</strong> React doesn't realize it needs to render the component again with the new data.</li>
</ol>
<p>To update a component with new data, two things need to happen:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Retain</strong> the data between renders.</li>
<li><strong>Trigger</strong> React to render the component with new data (re-rendering).</li>
</ol>
<p>The <a href="/reference/react/useState"><code>useState</code></a> Hook provides those two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <strong>state variable</strong> to retain the data between renders.</li>
<li>A <strong>state setter function</strong> to update the variable and trigger React to render the component again.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="adding-a-state-variable-adding-a-state-variable"><a class="header" href="#adding-a-state-variable-adding-a-state-variable">Adding a state variable {/<em>adding-a-state-variable</em>/}</a></h2>
<p>To add a state variable, import <code>useState</code> from React at the top of the file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import { useState } from 'react';
</code></pre>
<p>Then, replace this line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">let index = 0;
</code></pre>
<p>with</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
</code></pre>
<p><code>index</code> is a state variable and <code>setIndex</code> is the setter function.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> syntax here is called <a href="https://javascript.info/destructuring-assignment">array destructuring</a> and it lets you read values from an array. The array returned by <code>useState</code> always has exactly two items.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is how they work together in <code>handleClick</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">function handleClick() {
  setIndex(index + 1);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now clicking the &quot;Next&quot; button switches the current sculpture:</p>
<Sandpack>
<pre><code class="language-js">import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={handleClick}&gt;
        Next

<p>In React, <code>useState</code>, as well as any other function starting with &quot;<code>use</code>&quot;, is called a Hook.</p>
<p><em>Hooks</em> are special functions that are only available while React is <a href="/learn/render-and-commit#step-1-trigger-a-render">rendering</a> (which we'll get into in more detail on the next page). They let you &quot;hook into&quot; different React features.</p>
<p>State is just one of those features, but you will meet the other Hooks later.</p>
<Pitfall>
<p><strong>Hooks—functions starting with <code>use</code>—can only be called at the top level of your components or <a href="/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks">your own Hooks.</a></strong> You can't call Hooks inside conditions, loops, or other nested functions. Hooks are functions, but it's helpful to think of them as unconditional declarations about your component's needs. You &quot;use&quot; React features at the top of your component similar to how you &quot;import&quot; modules at the top of your file.</p>
</Pitfall>
<h3 id="anatomy-of-usestate-anatomy-of-usestate"><a class="header" href="#anatomy-of-usestate-anatomy-of-usestate">Anatomy of <code>useState</code> {/<em>anatomy-of-usestate</em>/}</a></h3>
<p>When you call <a href="/reference/react/useState"><code>useState</code></a>, you are telling React that you want this component to remember something:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, you want React to remember <code>index</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The convention is to name this pair like <code>const [something, setSomething]</code>. You could name it anything you like, but conventions make things easier to understand across projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only argument to <code>useState</code> is the <strong>initial value</strong> of your state variable. In this example, the <code>index</code>'s initial value is set to <code>0</code> with <code>useState(0)</code>. </p>
<p>Every time your component renders, <code>useState</code> gives you an array containing two values:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>state variable</strong> (<code>index</code>) with the value you stored.</li>
<li>The <strong>state setter function</strong> (<code>setIndex</code>) which can update the state variable and trigger React to render the component again.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's how that happens in action:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li><strong>Your component renders the first time.</strong> Because you passed <code>0</code> to <code>useState</code> as the initial value for <code>index</code>, it will return <code>[0, setIndex]</code>. React remembers <code>0</code> is the latest state value.</li>
<li><strong>You update the state.</strong> When a user clicks the button, it calls <code>setIndex(index + 1)</code>. <code>index</code> is <code>0</code>, so it's <code>setIndex(1)</code>. This tells React to remember <code>index</code> is <code>1</code> now and triggers another render.</li>
<li><strong>Your component's second render.</strong> React still sees <code>useState(0)</code>, but because React <em>remembers</em> that you set <code>index</code> to <code>1</code>, it returns <code>[1, setIndex]</code> instead.</li>
<li>And so on!</li>
</ol>

<p>It is a good idea to have multiple state variables if their state is unrelated, like <code>index</code> and <code>showMore</code> in this example. But if you find that you often change two state variables together, it might be better to combine them into a single one. For example, if you have a form with many fields, it's more convenient to have a single state variable that holds an object than state variable per field. <a href="/learn/choosing-the-state-structure">Choosing the State Structure</a> has more tips on this.</p>
<DeepDive>
<h4 id="how-does-react-know-which-state-to-return-how-does-react-know-which-state-to-return"><a class="header" href="#how-does-react-know-which-state-to-return-how-does-react-know-which-state-to-return">How does React know which state to return? {/<em>how-does-react-know-which-state-to-return</em>/}</a></h4>
<p>You might have noticed that the <code>useState</code> call does not receive any information about <em>which</em> state variable it refers to. There is no &quot;identifier&quot; that is passed to <code>useState</code>, so how does it know which of the state variables to return? Does it rely on some magic like parsing your functions? The answer is no.</p>
<p>Instead, to enable their concise syntax, Hooks <strong>rely on a stable call order on every render of the same component.</strong> This works well in practice because if you follow the rule above (&quot;only call Hooks at the top level&quot;), Hooks will always be called in the same order. Additionally, a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks">linter plugin</a> catches most mistakes.</p>
<p>Internally, React holds an array of state pairs for every component. It also maintains the current pair index, which is set to <code>0</code> before rendering. Each time you call <code>useState</code>, React gives you the next state pair and increments the index. You can read more about this mechanism in <a href="https://medium.com/@ryardley/react-hooks-not-magic-just-arrays-cd4f1857236e">React Hooks: Not Magic, Just Arrays.</a></p>
<p>This example <strong>doesn't use React</strong> but it gives you an idea of how <code>useState</code> works internally:</p>
<Sandpack>
<pre><code class="language-js index.js active">let componentHooks = [];
let currentHookIndex = 0;

// How useState works inside React (simplified).
function useState(initialState) {
  let pair = componentHooks[currentHookIndex];
  if (pair) {
    // This is not the first render,
    // so the state pair already exists.
    // Return it and prepare for next Hook call.
    currentHookIndex++;
    return pair;
  }

  // This is the first time we're rendering,
  // so create a state pair and store it.
  pair = [initialState, setState];

  function setState(nextState) {
    // When the user requests a state change,
    // put the new value into the pair.
    pair[0] = nextState;
    updateDOM();
  }

  // Store the pair for future renders
  // and prepare for the next Hook call.
  componentHooks[currentHookIndex] = pair;
  currentHookIndex++;
  return pair;
}

function Gallery() {
  // Each useState() call will get the next pair.
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  function handleNextClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  // This example doesn't use React, so
  // return an output object instead of JSX.

}

function updateDOM() {
  // Reset the current Hook index
  // before rendering the component.
  currentHookIndex = 0;
  let output = Gallery();

  // Update the DOM to match the output.

<p>This is what makes state different from regular variables that you might declare at the top of your module. State is not tied to a particular function call or a place in the code, but it's &quot;local&quot; to the specific place on the screen. You rendered two <code>&lt;Gallery /&gt;</code> components, so their state is stored separately.</p>
<p>Also notice how the <code>Page</code> component doesn't &quot;know&quot; anything about the <code>Gallery</code> state or even whether it has any. Unlike props, <strong>state is fully private to the component declaring it.</strong> The parent component can't change it. This lets you add state to any component or remove it without impacting the rest of the components.</p>
<p>What if you wanted both galleries to keep their states in sync? The right way to do it in React is to <em>remove</em> state from child components and add it to their closest shared parent. The next few pages will focus on organizing state of a single component, but we will return to this topic in <a href="/learn/sharing-state-between-components">Sharing State Between Components.</a></p>
<Recap>
<ul>
<li>Use a state variable when a component needs to &quot;remember&quot; some information between renders.</li>
<li>State variables are declared by calling the <code>useState</code> Hook.</li>
<li>Hooks are special functions that start with <code>use</code>. They let you &quot;hook into&quot; React features like state.</li>
<li>Hooks might remind you of imports: they need to be called unconditionally. Calling Hooks, including <code>useState</code>, is only valid at the top level of a component or another Hook.</li>
<li>The <code>useState</code> Hook returns a pair of values: the current state and the function to update it.</li>
<li>You can have more than one state variable. Internally, React matches them up by their order.</li>
<li>State is private to the component. If you render it in two places, each copy gets its own state.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you press &quot;Next&quot; on the last sculpture, the code crashes. Fix the logic to prevent the crash. You may do this by adding extra logic to event handler or by disabling the button when the action is not possible.</p>
<p>After fixing the crash, add a &quot;Previous&quot; button that shows the previous sculpture. It shouldn't crash on the first sculpture.</p>

<p>Notice how <code>hasPrev</code> and <code>hasNext</code> are used <em>both</em> for the returned JSX and inside the event handlers! This handy pattern works because event handler functions <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures">&quot;close over&quot;</a> any variables declared while rendering.</p>
</Solution>
<h4 id="fix-stuck-form-inputs-fix-stuck-form-inputs"><a class="header" href="#fix-stuck-form-inputs-fix-stuck-form-inputs">Fix stuck form inputs {/<em>fix-stuck-form-inputs</em>/}</a></h4>
<p>When you type into the input fields, nothing appears. It's like the input values are &quot;stuck&quot; with empty strings. The <code>value</code> of the first <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> is set to always match the <code>firstName</code> variable, and the <code>value</code> for the second <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> is set to always match the <code>lastName</code> variable. This is correct. Both inputs have <code>onChange</code> event handlers, which try to update the variables based on the latest user input (<code>e.target.value</code>). However, the variables don't seem to &quot;remember&quot; their values between re-renders. Fix this by using state variables instead.</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">export default function Form() {

<Solution>
<p>First, import <code>useState</code> from React. Then replace <code>firstName</code> and <code>lastName</code> with state variables declared by calling <code>useState</code>. Finally, replace every <code>firstName = ...</code> assignment with <code>setFirstName(...)</code>, and do the same for <code>lastName</code>. Don't forget to update <code>handleReset</code> too so that the reset button works.</p>
<Sandpack>
<pre><code class="language-js">import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    setFirstName(e.target.value);
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    setLastName(e.target.value);
  }

  function handleReset() {
    setFirstName('');
    setLastName('');

  return (
    &lt;form onSubmit={e =&gt; e.preventDefault()}&gt;

<p>Here is a small form that is supposed to let the user leave some feedback. When the feedback is submitted, it's supposed to display a thank-you message. However, it crashes with an error message saying &quot;Rendered fewer hooks than expected&quot;. Can you spot the mistake and fix it?</p>
<Hint>
<p>Are there any limitations on <em>where</em> Hooks may be called? Does this component break any rules? Check if there are any comments disabling the linter checks--this is where the bugs often hide!</p>

</code></pre>
</Sandpack>
<Solution>
<p>Hooks can only be called at the top level of the component function. Here, the first <code>isSent</code> definition follows this rule, but the <code>message</code> definition is nested in a condition.</p>
<p>Move it out of the condition to fix the issue:</p>
<Sandpack>
<pre><code class="language-js">import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  if (isSent) {
    return &lt;h1&gt;Thank you!&lt;/h1&gt;;
  } else {
    return (
      &lt;form onSubmit={e =&gt; {
        e.preventDefault();
        alert(`Sending: &quot;${message}&quot;`);
        setIsSent(true);
      }}&gt;
        &lt;textarea
          placeholder=&quot;Message&quot;
          value={message}
          onChange={e =&gt; setMessage(e.target.value)}
        /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;Send&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;
    );
  }
}
</code></pre>
</Sandpack>
<p>Remember, Hooks must be called unconditionally and always in the same order!</p>
<p>You could also remove the unnecessary <code>else</code> branch to reduce the nesting. However, it's still important that all calls to Hooks happen <em>before</em> the first <code>return</code>.</p>
<Sandpack>
<pre><code class="language-js">import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  if (isSent) {
    return &lt;h1&gt;Thank you!&lt;/h1&gt;;
  }

  return (
    &lt;form onSubmit={e =&gt; {
      e.preventDefault();
      alert(`Sending: &quot;${message}&quot;`);
      setIsSent(true);
    }}&gt;
      &lt;textarea
        placeholder=&quot;Message&quot;
        value={message}
        onChange={e =&gt; setMessage(e.target.value)}
      /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;Send&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>
</Sandpack>
<p>Try moving the second <code>useState</code> call after the <code>if</code> condition and notice how this breaks it again.</p>
<p>If your linter is <a href="/learn/editor-setup#linting">configured for React</a>, you should see a lint error when you make a mistake like this. If you don't see an error when you try the faulty code locally, you need to set up linting for your project. </p>

<p>When the button is clicked, this example should ask for the user's name and then display an alert greeting them. You tried to use state to keep the name, but for some reason it always shows &quot;Hello, !&quot;.</p>
<p>To fix this code, remove the unnecessary state variable. (We will discuss about <a href="/learn/state-as-a-snapshot">why this didn't work</a> later.)</p>
<p>Can you explain why this state variable was unnecessary?</p>

    &lt;button onClick={handleClick}&gt;
      Greet
    &lt;/button&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>
</Sandpack>
<Solution>
<p>Here is a fixed version that uses a regular <code>name</code> variable declared in the function that needs it:</p>
<Sandpack>
<pre><code class="language-js">import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  function handleClick() {
    const name = prompt('What is your name?');
    alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  }

  return (
    &lt;button onClick={handleClick}&gt;
      Greet
    &lt;/button&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>
</Sandpack>
<p>A state variable is only necessary to keep information between re-renders of a component. Within a single event handler, a regular variable will do fine. Don't introduce state variables when a regular variable works well.</p>
